# **Java API test automation**
An example of automated API tests in Java / Maven using JUnit as the test runner and Retrofit for the API communication. The application under test is webhook.site which I like to use in tests for receiving webhooks. I have been developing the whole automated API tests solution at Phrase since January 2022.
